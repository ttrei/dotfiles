= Nix

Configuration for both NixOS and standalone installations of Nix.

I will try to use home-manager on both.

How to decide whether a package should be installed by home-manager or NixOS system?
I think a promising answer is:

* home-manager installs packages that I will use in non-NixOS distros
* All other packages go into NixOS configuration.nix

== Standalone Nix

=== Install on Debian

== NixOS

Configuration was imported from `ssh://reinis@taukulis.lv:/home/reinis/gitrepos/nixos.git`.
State of all branches of that repository is recorded in `nixos-config/attic/dev-nixos-git-branches`
directory.

=== todo

=== done

==== Make sure that on login .bashrc is sourced only once

==== NixOS doesn't load bash profile

`.profile` adjusts PATH to include `~/bin` which is important for us.

My solution is to source the "legacy" config files using `profileExtra` and `bashrcExtra`.
Also needed to add `~/.xprofile` that loads `~/.profile` explicitly on i3 login.
