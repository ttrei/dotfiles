= dotfiles

Configuration for the software I use.

The configuration files are organized by area: terminal, net, nvim, etc.
The file tree doesn't directly reflect how it will look in your home directory.

Some of the configuration is deployed via [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
It is my intention to gradually migrate everything to home-manager.

== Deploy

. Choose environment config from `configs/` by running `bin/select-config.sh`.
  The config file will be copied to `$HOME/.dotfiles-env`.
. Execute `bin/deploy.sh`.
