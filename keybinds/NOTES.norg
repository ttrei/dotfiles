** Parse neovim and i3 keybinds

   Python script to parse the keybinds into usable form.

** Use rofi or fzf to search the keybinds

   Two modes of operation:

   - When I want to define a new keybind, I want to know that it is not taken yet.
     In this case, search by the "lhs" of the keybind.

   - When I want to remember how to do something, search by the "rhs" of the keybind.
