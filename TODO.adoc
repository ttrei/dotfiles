== Improve the deployment mechanism.

Vision:
1. Detect where we are deploying (which OS, which machine, home or work).
   Store this info in env variables.
2. Select the correct old-style symlink tree directory based on the above.
3. Copy the symlink tree to a temporary directory.
4. Add additional stuff to the temporary directory. Intention is to gradually migrate configs from
   the old-style symlink tree.
5. Deploy the temp directory to $HOME.
6. Or show a diff between current $HOME state and the temp directory.

== Sway

* IntelliJ needs `export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1`
