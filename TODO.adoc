== script for rebasing onto remote tracking branch

== Always deploy the branch intended for given host

Read the intended branch name from a file under `/var/tmp`.
This way we can always stay on master.

`diff_deployed.sh` should also diff against the intended branch.

== Migrate to home-manager

Migration should be gradual.

== One branch to rule them all

Ideally there would be only one branch.
It is easier to get and overview of all configuration when you don't have to hop
between branches.

Update (2021-06-06).
Reduced diffs between branches.
Any diff between branches is now localized in `.deploy` directory.

Next step would be to rework deployment procedure so that all different deployments can live
together in master.
